## Example

Consider the following game. You are given a sequence of $n$ positive numbers
$(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$. Initially, they are all colored black. At each move,
you choose a black number $a_k$ and color it and its immediate neighbors (if
any) red (the immediate neighbors are the elements $a_{k-1}$, $a_{k+1}$ ). You
get $a_k$ points for this move. The game ends when all numbers are colored
red. The goal is to get as many points as possible.

Describe and analyze an efficient dynamic programming algorithm for this problem that runs in O(n) and returns optimal solutions. (9 pts)
